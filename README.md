# Background

My name is Ignacio Borrego and welcome to my Project portfolio. Allow me to introduce myself. I did my undergraduate at Universidad Cat√≥lica Argentina (UCA) 
where I majored in Accounting. I started working in a small company as a Junior accounting assistant back in 2015 while I was studying. I was part of the accounting 
department and I performed monthly bank reconciliations, billing control and accounting entries in Bejerman ERP system. Two years later I decided to quit in order
to focus on my studies.
<head> I graduated just before the pandemic started. After some months looking for a job, I joined ExxonMobil in December 2020 as a Controllers senior analyst where I mainly<head/>
ensured accuracy of the financial reporting for the Downstream business and also gave accounting support. Apart from my accounting duties, I always spent a lot of time 
on task automation. For instance, part of my job was managing a large number of intercompany charges and sending them to the corresponding account and cost center. In order to do that automatically, I created some rules in SAP which allowed me not only to reduce that manual work but also to minimize the margin of error. My supervisor
was aware of the number of charges I automated so he put me in charge of delivering presentations to other teams on the importance of automating and how to do it correctly. It became so interesting to me that I created a xls file in which I asked my co-workers how many charges they had automated. With that data I generated some kpi's that measured the percentage of charges that had been automated and also tracked the increase or decrease over the months.<br>
<head/>After a few months I asked my supervisor if there was a possibility to transition to a more data-driven team. I was told I will be considered for future positions and in the meantime I started to take several courses related to SQL and power bi until I decided to change my career path and look for  other possibilites related to my new interest.<head/>

I am now transitioning to data analyst, and I'm doing my personal projects which will allow me to improve my both SQL and dashboard assembly skills.
