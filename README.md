Background

My name is Ignacio Borrego and welcome to my Project portfolio. Allow me to introduce myself. I did my undergraduate at Universidad Cat√≥lica Argentina (UCA) 
where I majored in Accounting. I started working in a small company as a Junior accounting assistant back in 2015 while I was studying. I was part of the accounting 
department and I performed monthly bank reconciliations, billing control and accounting entries in Bejerman ERP system. Two years later I decided to quit in order
to focus on my studies.
<head> I graduated just before the pandemic started. After some months looking for a job, I joined ExxonMobil in September 2020 as a Controllers senior analyst where I mainly<head/>
ensured accuracy of the financial reporting for the Downstream business and also gave accounting support. 

I am now transitioning to data analyst, and I'm doing my personal projects which will allow me to improve my both SQL and dashboard assembly skills.
