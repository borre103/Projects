#Summary

The dataset is a survey of data professionals from different parts of the world. The investigation aimed to gain some insights into both the survey taker's professional
and personal life. Some of the questions were about their current role, their salary, favorite programming language and what industry are they working in. Regarding
the personal questions, they had to do with the gender, age, which country are they living and some other interesting questions. 

I transformed the data using power query and then I created some fascinating visualizations. In the power query editor I split some columns in order to eliminate
all the specific answers, so instead I categorized into "other" section. As for the yearly salary column, each row was a range, so in order to get to use that 
information I divided that column into two (the minimum and maximum) and calculated the average.


#Analysis:

It's important to note that the majority of respondents are from the United States with India in second place. The reason of this is because the average annual
salary can change when selecting a specific country, due to the cost of living. Taking that into account, the highest paid position is Data Scientist, 
with an average annual salary of 94,000. On the other hand, nearly two thirds of the survey takers has switched their career into data which explains its
popularity. Also, half of the respondents stated that they entered the data world with only a Bachelor's degree, suggesting that a master's degree is not necessary.
Last but not least, 67% of the survey takers use python on a daily basis, with R in second place, suggesting that it is a tool to study if you want to enter the job market.
