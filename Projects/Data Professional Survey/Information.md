# Summary

The dataset is a survey of data professionals from different parts of the world. The investigation aimed to gain some insights into both the survey taker's professional
and personal life. Some of the questions posed in the survey were about their current role, their salary, favorite programming language and what industry are they working in. Personal questions included gender, age, which country are they living and some other intriguing queries. 

To effectively analyze the data, I utilized power query to transform it and then proceeded to create captivating visualizations. In the power query editor I split some columns in order to eliminate all the specific answers, so instead I categorized into "other" section. As for the yearly salary column, the data was presented in ranges, and in order to effectively utilize the information, I divided the column into two separate fields (minimum and maximum) and subsequently calculated the average.
