# Summary

  For this project, I utilized various measures and calculations to compile a sales report that includes multiple visual aids. I imported data from different sources into Power BI and proceeded to cleanse and transform the data in order to create an optimal Sales Dashboard. Firstly, I ensured that there were no errors present in any tables, after which I segregated the Country and City in the "Location" field. I then modified the Data Types of each field according to its most suitable category. Additionally, I created a unique key (GeoKey) in the Geography table, as well as a Calendar table that proved to be particularly useful when developing the dashboard. In the Calendar table, I established various columns such as year, month, month name, week number, quarter, and week day.
  Moving on to the sales table, I computed the Total Revenue by multiplying the retail price of each product by the corresponding unit sales. I also computed the Total Cost by multiplying the Standard Cost of each product by the units sold. With these new sets of data, I was able to calculate the Gross Profit.
