# Summary

In this project I used measures and calculations to assemble a sales report with different visuals. After loading the data in Power Bi from different sources, I cleaned and transformed the data to best show the Sales Dashboard. I made sure that there were no errors in any table, then I split the Country from the City in field "Location". I changed the Data Types that best suited the fields. Also I created a unique key (GEoKey) in Geography table
