# Summary 

The objective of this project was to analyze a retail dataset of a global superstore for 4 years. I did an analysis of this dataset for the final project of the CoderHouse Data Analytics course. This analysis aims to help the company's top management in decision making by going from the most general to the most specific. 
Starting with the finance performance of the company, through an analysis of orders and products, to an exhaustive analysis of customers and their location.
To the chosen database, I decided to add data to make the analysis juicier, as follows:
- I added clients' ages ranging from 20 to 60 years old, as well as their gender
- To the orders I added the time of purchase to determine the most popular time of day.
- I added the price and cost of the products to determine which is the most profitable product, as well as its profit percentage.
