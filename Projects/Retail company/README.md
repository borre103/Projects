# Summary 

The objective of this project was to analyze a retail dataset of a global superstore for 4 years. I did an analysis of this dataset for the final project of the CoderHouse Data Analytics course. This analysis aims to help the company's top management in decision making by going from the most general to the most specific. 
Starting with the finance performance of the company, through an analysis of orders and products, to an exhaustive analysis of customers and their location.
To the chosen database, I decided to add data to make the analysis juicier, as follows:
- I added clients' ages ranging from 20 to 60 years old, as well as their gender
- To the orders I added the time of purchase to determine the most popular time of day.
- I added the price and cost of the products to determine which is the most profitable product, as well as its profit percentage.

In the orders tab, I obtained the time and day of the week when most purchases are made with DAX functions in conjuntion with an SQL query, which I found interesting for a marketing strategy. Similarly I determined the average number of days it takes for the product to arrive depending on the ship mode.

Regarding the product tab, I added a column called profit, which is the difference between the price and the cost of the products. I also performed a SQL query to
determine which is the best selling product.

Finally, in the customers tab, I performed a SQL query grouping the customers by their age, determing the age group of the customers who are most consuming.
In addition I calculated the top five buyers and the amount of money they have spent, being able to filter the gender of the buyers.
