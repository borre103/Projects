# Summary 

The objective of this project was to analyze a retail dataset of a global superstore over a four-year period. This analysis was conducted as the final project for the CoderHouse Data Analytics course. This study aims to help the company's top management in decision making by going from the most general to the most specific. 
Starting with the finance performance of the company, through an analysis of orders and products, to an exhaustive observation of customers and their location.
To the chosen database, I decided to add data to make the investigation juicier, as follows:
- I added clients' ages ranging from 20 to 60 years old, as well as their gender
- To the orders I added the time of purchase to determine the most popular time of day.
- I added the price and cost of the products to determine which is the most profitable product, as well as its profit percentage.

Using DAX functions in conjunction with an SQL query, I identified the time and day of the week when the majority of purchases are made in the orders tab, which I found interesting for marketing strategies. Similarly I determined the average number of days it takes for the product to arrive depending on the ship mode.

In the product tab, I created a profit column that calculates the difference between the price and the cost of each product, and used SQL to identify the best selling product

Finally, I grouped customers by age using an SQL query, and determined the age group that is most frequently consuming. Furthermore, I calculated the top five buyers and the amount of money they spent, with the ability to filter by gender.
